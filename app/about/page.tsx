              <p className="mb-4">
                CVG Family Law was founded by Cora and Bridget with a simple yet powerful vision: 
                to provide exceptional family law services that combine legal expertise with genuine 
                compassion and understanding.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Based in the heart of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, we&apos;ve built our practice on the 
                belief that every family deserves access to high-quality legal support during their 
                most difficult times. Our passion for domestic abuse advocacy and children&apos;s 
                welfare drives everything we do.
              </p>
              <p>
                We understand that family law matters are deeply personal. That&apos;s why we take 
                a forward-thinking, contemporary approach that puts your needs first, offering 
                practical solutions and emotional support alongside expert legal guidance.

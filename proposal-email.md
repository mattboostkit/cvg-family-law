# Project Proposal Email Draft

Subject: Elevating CVG Family Law’s Digital Presence for 2025

Hi Cora & Bridget,

Thank you again for sharing the vision for CVG Family Law online. Over the last few weeks, we’ve completed a deep dive into your current site and the new Next.js build. The takeaways are clear: there is a real opportunity to produce a world-class digital experience that reflects your specialist practice, ranks competitively for domestic abuse and family law terms across Kent, and makes it effortless for survivors to find the support they need.

## Why the refresh matters now
- **Survivor-first journey** – The present site relies on a generic template. By building the tailored design we’ve prototyped (hero, survivor pathways, resource hubs, private browsing), we can reassure visitors instantly and deliver the urgent help they expect.
- **Local search leadership** – Competitors are investing in structured content, blogs, and location pages. Implementing the new IA, Sanity CMS, and metadata strategy positions CVG as the go-to result for “domestic abuse solicitor Tunbridge Wells”, “children law specialist Kent”, and related terms.
- **Practice scaling** – With Hollie guarding, court updates, and resource guides all managed in a CMS, your team can publish frequently without a developer, keeping the site legally current and Google-friendly.
- **Accessibility & trust** – Private mode, quick exits, accessible copy and imagery, and auditable resource lists ensure we meet trauma-informed best practices and align with professional obligations.

## Implementation plan (6–7 weeks)

1. **Discovery & Content Architecture (Week 1)**
   - Finalise page map (Home, About, Services, Domestic Abuse microsite, Resources, Blog, Locations, FAQs).
   - Workshop copy priorities (intros, CTAs, testimonials, legal disclosures).
   - Gather imagery/iconography requirements.

2. **Design Refinement (Weeks 1–2)**
   - Translate existing prototypes into polished design system (colour, typography, components, micro-interactions).
   - Produce responsive layouts for key templates (Home, Service detail, Resource hub, Blog).
   - Draft private-mode visual adjustments and motion guidelines.

3. **Build & CMS Integration (Weeks 2–5)**
   - Implement Next.js 15 app with server components for performance, client islands for interactivity (hero animations, carousels).
   - Integrate Sanity CMS: schema for services, team bios, blog posts, testimonials, resources, locations.
   - Wire navigation, anchor links, and contact flows.
   - Implement analytics (GA4), cookie management, structured data (LegalService, Article, FAQ), sitemap/robots.
   - Configure Vercel for staging, preview drafts, and edge caching.

4. **Content Migration & QA (Week 5–6)**
   - Populate Sanity with copy from current site + refreshed content (Holly, Cora, Bridget bios, guides, Hollie Guard resource, domestic abuse copy).
   - Migrate existing blog posts (if applicable) or seed with new articles.
   - Validate multi-device accessibility, colour contrast, keyboard navigation.
   - Test survivor flows: private mode, quick exit, contact form, resource downloads.

5. **Launch & Training (Week 6–7)**
   - Final regression testing on production domain, configure DNS cut-over.
   - Run performance audits (Lighthouse, WebPageTest) and search checks (IndexNow fetch, schema validation).
   - Deliver Sanity training session + CMS handbook.
   - Set up monitoring (Vercel analytics, uptime alerts) and define support cadence.
